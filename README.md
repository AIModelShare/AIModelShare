### AI Model Share

- The AI Model Share Project is a newly funded academic center at Columbia University. Its mission is to generate the tools needed to assist students, faculty, and the wider data science community to bring machine learning innovations to all manner of end-users, and in so doing to build a platform that will act as the world's trusted academic repository for machine learning model prediction APIs.

- The platform now enables faculty, students, and the wider data science community to launch machine learning models into scalable production ready prediction REST APIs using a single Python function. Details about each model, how to use the model's API, and the model's author(s) are deployed simultaneously into a searchable website at Columbia. Data scientists (faculty, students and otherwise) have individual model detail pages listing information about all deployed models. Each of these pages includes a fully functional prediction dashboard that allows end-users to input text, tabular, or image data and receive live predictions. Moreover, documentation for prediction API usage via Curl, Python, and R code are also available.

- In a matter of seconds, data scientists can launch a model into this infrastructure and end-users the world over will be able to engage their machine learning models. A developer version of the platform is currently being used by Columbia students, faculty, and staff to test and improve platform functionality.
