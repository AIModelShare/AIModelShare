### The mission of the AI Model Share Platform is to provide a trusted non profit repository for machine learning model prediction APIs (python library + integrated website at modelshare.org.  A beta version of the platform is currently being used by Columbia University students, faculty, and staff to test and improve platform functionality.

### In a matter of seconds, data scientists can launch a model into this infrastructure and end-users the world over will be able to engage their machine learning models.

* ***Launch machine learning models into scalable production ready prediction REST APIs using a single Python function.*** 

* ***Details about each model, how to use the model's API, and the model's author(s) are deployed simultaneously into a searchable website at modelshare.org.*** 

* ***Deployed models receive an individual Model Playground listing information about all deployed models. Each of these pages includes a fully functional prediction dashboard that allows end-users to input text, tabular, or image data and receive live predictions.*** 

# Use aimodelshare Python library to deploy your model
* [Tutorials for deploying models](https://www.modelshare.org/search/deploy?search=ALL&problemdomain=ALL&gettingstartedguide=TRUE&pythonlibrariesused=ALL&tags=ALL&pageNum=1).

# Find model detail pages and generate predictions
* [View deployed models and generate predictions at modelshare.org](https://www.modelshare.org)

# Installation

You can then install aimodelshare from PyPi
```
pip install aimodelshare
```
