- The AI Model Share Platform (website + integrated Python library) aims to become the worldâ€™s first academic/not for profit website used to store, find, and make use of machine learning models via live prediction REST APIs and prediction playground web-applications.  In a matter of seconds, data scientists can launch a model into this infrastructure and end-users the world over can engage their machine learning models. A developer version of the platform is currently being used by Columbia University students, faculty, and staff to test and improve platform functionality.

### NOTE: ADD NEW DIAGRAM IMAGE: DEPLOY, SEARCH, PREDICT, COMPETE

  * ***Launch machine learning models into scalable production ready prediction REST APIs using a single Python function.*** 

  * ***Details about each model, how to use the model's API, and the model's author(s) are deployed simultaneously into a searchable website at modelshare.org.*** 

  * ***Every deployed model receives an individual model detail pages listing information about all deployed models. Each of these pages includes a fully functional prediction dashboard that allows end-users to input text, tabular, or image data and receive live predictions.*** 
  
   * ***Every deployed model is also a machine learning competition.  Model developers receive a key that they can share with other ML engineers to submit new models to the project, new model submissions are evaluated on held out test data and comparative metrics are available on an autogenerated leaderboard.***
